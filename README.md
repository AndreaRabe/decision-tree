# **Decision Tree**  

This project provides an implementation of decision trees for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. It showcases various approaches using libraries like **scikit-learn** and **ChefBoost**, implementing algorithms such as **CART**, **C4.5**, and **ID3**.  

The project is developed and executed on **Google Colab**, a free online platform that provides a Jupyter Notebook-like environment with GPU support and pre-installed libraries, making it easy to run and share Python code directly in the cloud.
